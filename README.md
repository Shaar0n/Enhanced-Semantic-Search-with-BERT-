# Enhanced-Semantic-Search-with-BERT-
This application Leverages BERT for tag generation for small scale semantic search

This study investigates the use of BERT to enhance semantic search through advanced tag generation. Traditional keyword-based search methods often struggle to grasp the deeper meaning and context of user queries, resulting in less relevant outcomes. By harnessing BERT's deep learning capabilities, this research aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of information retrieval. The approach involves training a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify and classify entities within search queries, which are then utilized for BERT-driven tag generation. Additionally, multi-tag analysis is employed to refine search precision by examining the relationships and intersections between tagged entities. This research holds significant value in addressing challenges such as ambiguity and context sensitivity in natural language queries, contributing to advancements in semantic search and information retrieval.
